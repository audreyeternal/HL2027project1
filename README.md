# 3D CT Image Reconstruction 
## introduction
The algorithm aims to reconstruct the 3D CT image **with white noise**.  
The algorithm main features:
* use huber regularization 
* use conjugated gradient reconstruction method.  

The method is tested both in phantom image as well as in realistic 3D image.
